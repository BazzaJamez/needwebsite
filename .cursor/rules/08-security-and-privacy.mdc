**Auth**
- Use OAuth/passkey-first with session rotation; CSRF on all mutations.

**Data**
- Principle of least privilege; server actions prefer RSC over client calls.
- Secrets in env only; never commit keys. Audit logs for admin actions.

**Compliance**
- Treat payment and PII as restricted scopes; apply data retention windows.
