**Tokens**
- Define CSS variables in styles/tokens.css and mirror them in tailwind.config.{ts,js}.
- Never hardcode colors/spacing; use tokens or Tailwind utilities.

**Typography**
- System font stack. Sizes follow 1.2 modular scale; line-height ≥ 1.4.

**Components**
- Use shadcn/ui primitives wrapped in components/ui/* (Button, Input, Card, Dialog, Sheet, Dropdown, DataTable).
- Build composites in components/* (SearchBar, ServiceCard, SellerBadge, QuoteBuilder).
- Variants via cva() or class-variance-authority. No ad-hoc class strings for state.

**Accessibility**
- All interactive components must use Radix where possible.
- Focus rings: visible, offset 2. Minimum color contrast 4.5:1.
