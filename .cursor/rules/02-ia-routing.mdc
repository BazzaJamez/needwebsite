**Route groups**
- (marketing) public pages; (auth) sign-in/up; (app) buyer/seller app; (admin) ops.
- Example:
  - app/(marketing)/page.tsx
  - app/(auth)/signin/page.tsx
  - app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx
  - app/(app)/services/[slug]/page.tsx
  - app/(app)/orders/[id]/page.tsx
  - app/(app)/messages/[threadId]/page.tsx

**Data fetching**
- Server Components + fetch with `{ next: { revalidate: 60 } }` for public data.
- Use Route Handlers in `app/api/**` for server logic, not client calls.

**SEO**
- Use `export const metadata` per route. Canonicals via baseUrl in `next.config`.
- Sitemaps: route `app/sitemap.ts` plus dynamic entries from services and profiles.
