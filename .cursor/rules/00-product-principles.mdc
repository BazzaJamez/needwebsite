**North star**
- Feel obvious, calm, and respectful. Anticipate intent. Zero clutter.
- Marketplace = trust first: clarity of scope, fair pricing, accurate timelines.

**Design language**
- Spacious, 8pt grid. Very few borders; rely on elevation, spacing, and typography.
- Motion is subtle and purposeful (200–250ms). No surprise animations.

**Content style**
- Short, neutral, assistive. Imperatives > questions. No marketing fluff in core flows.

**Platform**
- Next.js App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + Radix + TanStack Query.
- Server Components by default; promote to Client only when interactive state is required.
